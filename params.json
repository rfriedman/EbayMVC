{"name":"Ebaymvc","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nEbayMVC is a web page that utilizes the [EbayFactory](https://github.com/rfriedman/EbayFactory) WCF service to show and search for Ebay listings.  The initial home page is a subset of items stored in a MsSql database.  The index controller produces the subset and passes it to the Model to View.  The Search Results page is very similar but the results come directly from an Ebay call not from items in a database.\r\n\r\n### Feel free to contribute your own branch\r\n```\r\n$ git://github.com/rfriedman/EbayMVC.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contact Info\r\n**friedman.richard@gmail.com**\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
